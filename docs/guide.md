## Installing Superstruct

To install Superstruct with Yarn or Npm, simply:

```bash
yarn add superstruct
```
```bash
npm install --save superstruct
```

And then you can import it into your code base:

```js
import { struct, superstruct } from 'superstruct'
```

If you would rather import Superstruct with a `<script>` tag, you can use the bundled build:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/superstruct/dist/superstruct.min.js"></script>
```

This will expose the `Superstruct` global with the exported functions.
